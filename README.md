### Description and Purpose

A modern, responsive, and customizable authentication UI built with React Native. Designed for clean, accessible login and registration experiences using basic email/password input, it offers a visually appealing interface that fits seamlessly into any mobile app's branding. Ideal as a starting point, this UI provides a solid foundation for developers to integrate real authentication systems into full-stack applications.

### Features

- Polished Login and Register Screens.
- Clean and minimal layout.
- Mobile design.
- Easy to customize and extend.

### Tech Stack

- React Native built with Expo ([Expo](https://expo.dev))
- Expo Router
- Stylesheet API

#### Additional Libraries:

- **@expo/vector-icons** - Used to provide customizable icons for branding.
- **Fonts** - Google Fonts via expo-font.

#### Other:

- **Code Editor / IDE:** I would recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio code (VS Code) as your preferred code editor / IDE to explore this project. If you do not have VS Code installed and require assistance with downloading and installation, please refer to this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview
- **Expo Go Application:** The **Expo Go app** is essential for previewing and testing your React Native projects on your mobile device in real-time. It allows you to run your app without needing a physical device setup or simulator, as long as you have the app installed. Simply scan the QR code generated by Expo while the app is running, and youâ€™ll see the changes reflected instantly on your device as you code.

### Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

#### Pre-requisites:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later), which includes npm by default. **LINK**: https://nodejs.org/en
- **Expo Go App:** Install the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device to preview the project in real-time. Expo Go allows you to scan a QR code from your terminal and instantly view your **React Native** app on your device without requiring a physical device setup or emulator. To install Expo Go, simply open the **Google Play Store** on **Android** or the **Apple App Store** on **iOS**, search for Expo Go, and install the app on your device.

#### Steps:

1. **Create a directory for the project:** Open your terminal and run mkdir `<your-directory-name>` | cd `<your-directory-name>`.
2. **Open the folder in VS Code:** run `code .`
3. **Clone the repository into the folder:** git clone https://github.com/kovymun/react-native-auth-ui.git
4. **Navigate into the project folder:** cd react-native-auth-ui
5. **Install all dependencies:** npm install
6. **Start the Expo development server:** npx expo start
7. **Preview the app on your mobile device:**

- Use Expo Go to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal.
- On iOS, use the built-in Camera app to scan the QR.
- On Android, scan using the Expo Go app directly.

### Usage Guide

Follow the steps below to interact with the application:

1. **Start the application:** First, complete the steps outlined in the Installation Guide to run the project locally. Once the development server is running, open the app on your mobile device using the Expo Go app.
2. **Explore the main screens:** The application includes the following core screens:

- **Login Screen:** A clean and modern interface for users to sign in using their email and password. The layout includes branding, basic form fields, and a sign-in button.
- **Create Account (Register) Screen:** A user-friendly registration form that captures essential sign-up details. It includes placeholders for terms and conditions, and a link to switch to the login screen.

3. **Navigate the app:** Toggle between the Login and Create Account screens via links provided within each screen. This allows you to simulate a typical authentication user flow.

**Note:** This app is a UI-only demo with no backend or form validation functionality. It is designed to serve as a visual and structural foundation for future full-stack integration.
